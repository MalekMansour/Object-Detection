# File: ssd_object_detection.py

## Goal:
The goal of this Python script is to perform real-time object detection using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm with MobileNet as the base network architecture.

## Why?:
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and image understanding. SSD offers a good balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## How?:
The script utilizes the MobileNet SSD model pre-trained on the COCO dataset. It accesses a live video stream or a video file, captures frames, performs object detection inference using the SSD model, and visualizes the results by drawing bounding boxes around detected objects along with their class labels and confidence scores. It employs OpenCV for image processing tasks and the imutils library for convenient frame resizing. Additionally, it provides an option to utilize GPU acceleration if available.
